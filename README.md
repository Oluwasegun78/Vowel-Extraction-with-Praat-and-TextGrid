# Vowel-Extraction-with-Praat-and-TextGrid
This is a Google Colabâ€“ready workflow for extracting vowel formants and related acoustic features from .wav audio files aligned with .TextGrid annotations, using Praat-Parselmouth and Python.

The script:
- Extracts vowel formants (F1, F2, F3 at 20 points), duration, and other acoustic features from .wav + .TextGrid.

- Uses Praat-Parselmouth for acoustic analysis.

- Outputs results as CSV for further statistical analysis.
